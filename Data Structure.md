# Tree

## Binary Search Tree

### Balance Search Tree

Guaranteed height of log(n) when n items present 

#### Red Black Tree

Decolor,rotation

For hash tables (like dicts or sets), insertion and lookup are O(1), while for a balanced tree these are O(log(n)). In-order traversal of keys is O(n) in a tree, but to do the same thing with a hash table you need to sort the keys first, so it's O(n*log(n))

1. Root and NIL leaves are always black
2. If node is red, its children are black
3. All path from a node to Null leave have the same black nodes
4. Longest path are no more than twice the length of the shortest
